## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*, but you may want to wait until you feel comfortable wtih basic SQL query writing. 

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Design a logical data model
- Duplicate the logical data model and add another table to it following the instructions
- Write, within this markdown file, an answer to Prompt 3


###  Design a Logical Model

#### Prompt 1
Design a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. 

Additionally, include a date table. 

There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

**HINT:** You do not need to create any data for this prompt. This is a conceptual model only.

#### Prompt 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

![alt text](<Bookstore Logical Model-2.png>)

#### Prompt 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2? 

**HINT:** search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions. 
## MY ANSWER

Customer Address Architectures
Architecture 1: Overwrite Changes (Type 1)
In this architecture, the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table will overwrite the old address with the new one whenever there is a change. This means that only the most recent address is stored, and historical data is not retained.
Type 1: This method is simple and easy to maintain but does not keep a history of address changes.

Architecture 2: Retain Changes (Type 2)
In this architecture, the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table will retain historical data by creating a new record for each address change. This allows tracking of all previous addresses.
Type 2: This method tracks historical data by adding new rows for each change, preserving the history of address changes.

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 4*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment2.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment2.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question


### Write SQL

#### COALESCE
1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:
```
SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product
```

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

**HINT**: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. All the other rows will remain the same.

<div align="center">-</div>

## MYSQL

SELECT 
    COALESCE(product_name || ', ' || COALESCE(product_size, '') || ' (' || COALESCE(product_qty_type, 'unit') || ')', '') AS new_product
FROM product;

#### Windowed Functions
1. Write a query that selects from the customer_purchases table and numbers each customerâ€™s visits to the farmerâ€™s market (labeling each market date with a different number). Each customerâ€™s first visit is labeled 1, second visit is labeled 2, etc. 

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer (without purchase details) and number those visits. 

**HINT**: One of these approaches uses ROW_NUMBER() and one uses DENSE_RANK().

## MYSQL

## using ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    market_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date) AS visit_number
FROM customer_purchases;

## using DENSE_RANK()
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    market_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date) AS visit_number
FROM customer_purchases
GROUP BY customer_id, market_date;

2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customerâ€™s most recent visit is labeled 1, then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to only the customerâ€™s most recent visit.

## MYSQL

WITH recent_visits AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        market_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY market_date DESC) AS visit_number
    FROM customer_purchases
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    market_date
FROM recent_visits
WHERE visit_number = 1;

3. Using a COUNT() window function, include a value along with each row of the customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id.

<div align="center">-</div>

## MY SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    cp.customer_id,
    cp.product_id,
    p.product_name,
	cp.market_date,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY cp.customer_id, cp.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM customer_purchases cp
JOIN product p ON cp.product_id = p.product_id;

#### String manipulations
1. Some product names in the product table have descriptions like "Jar" or "Organic". These are separated from the product name with a hyphen. Create a column using SUBSTR (and a couple of other commands) that captures these, but is otherwise NULL. Remove any trailing or leading whitespaces. Don't just use a case statement for each product! 

| product_name               | description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| Habanero Peppers - Organic | Organic     |

**HINT**: you might need to use INSTR(product_name,'-') to find the hyphens. INSTR will help split the column. 

<div align="center">-</div>

## MY SQL

SELECT 
    product_name,
    TRIM(SUBSTR(product_name, INSTR(product_name, '-') + 1)) AS description
FROM 
    product
WHERE 
    INSTR(product_name, '-') > 0;

#### UNION
1. Using a UNION, write a query that displays the market dates with the highest and lowest total sales.

**HINT**: There are a possibly a few ways to do this query, but if you're struggling, try the following: 1) Create a CTE/Temp Table to find sales values grouped dates; 2) Create another CTE/Temp table with a rank windowed function on the previous query to create "best day" and "worst day"; 3) Query the second temp table twice, once for the best day, once for the worst day, with a UNION binding them. 

***

## MY SQL

--UNION
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_by_date;
CREATE TEMP TABLE sales_by_date AS

SELECT 
        market_date, 
        SUM(quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty) AS total_sales
    FROM customer_purchases
    GROUP BY market_date;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ranked_sales;
CREATE TEMP TABLE ranked_sales AS
SELECT 
        market_date, 
        total_sales,
		RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS best_day,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales ASC) AS worst_day
    FROM sales_by_date;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BestDay;	
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE BestDay AS
SELECT 
    market_date,
    total_sales,
	best_day
	--worst_day
FROM 
    ranked_sales
WHERE 
    best_day= 1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS WorstDay;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE WorstDay AS
SELECT 
    market_date,
    total_sales,
	best_day
	--worst_day
FROM 
    ranked_sales
WHERE 
    worst_day = 1;

SELECT * 
FROM BestDay

UNION

SELECT * 
FROM WorstDay;

### Write SQL

#### Cross Join
1. Suppose every vendor in the `vendor_inventory` table had 5 of each of their products to sell to **every** customer on record. How much money would each vendor make per product? Show this by vendor_name and product name, rather than using the IDs.

**HINT**: Be sure you select only relevant columns and rows. Remember, CROSS JOIN will explode your table rows, so CROSS JOIN should likely be a subquery. Think a bit about the row counts: how many distinct vendors, product names are there (x)? How many customers are there (y). Before your final group by you should have the product of those two queries (x\*y). 

<div align="center">-</div>

## MY SQL

WITH vendor_products AS (
    SELECT 
        v.vendor_id,
        p.product_name,
		vr.vendor_name,
        v.original_price
    FROM 
        vendor_inventory v
    JOIN 
		product p ON v.product_id = p.product_id,
		vendor vr ON vr.vendor_id = v.vendor_id
) ,
customer_count AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customer
    FROM 
        customer
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    vp.vendor_id,
    vp.product_name,
	vp.vendor_name,
    vp.original_price * 5 * cc.total_customer AS total_sales
FROM 
    vendor_products vp
CROSS JOIN 
    customer_count cc
	GROUP BY vendor_name, product_name


#### INSERT
1. Create a new table "product_units". This table will contain only products where the `product_qty_type = 'unit'`. It should use all of the columns from the product table, as well as a new column for the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.  Name the timestamp column `snapshot_timestamp`.

2. Using `INSERT`, add a new row to the product_unit table (with an updated timestamp). This can be any product you desire (e.g. add another record for Apple Pie). 

<div align="center">-</div>

## MY SQL

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_units;
CREATE TEMP TABLE IF NOT EXISTS product_units AS
SELECT *,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS snapshot_timestamp
FROM 
    product
WHERE 
    product_qty_type = 'unit';

INSERT INTO product_units (product_id, product_name, product_size, product_category_id, product_qty_type, snapshot_timestamp)
VALUES (101, 'Apple Pie', 'Large', 1, 'unit', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

SELECT * FROM product_units;

#### DELETE 
1. Delete the older record for the whatever product you added.

**HINT**: If you don't specify a WHERE clause, [you are going to have a bad time](https://imgflip.com/i/8iq872).

<div align="center">-</div>

## MY SQL

SELECT * 
FROM product_units
WHERE product_name = 'Apple Pie';

DELETE FROM 
    product_units
WHERE 
    product_name = 'Apple Pie' AND product_id = 7;

  SELECT * 
FROM product_units


#### UPDATE
1. We want to add the current_quantity to the product_units table. First, add a new column, `current_quantity` to the table using the following syntax.
```
ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;
```

Then, using `UPDATE`, change the current_quantity equal to the **last** `quantity` value from the vendor_inventory details. 

**HINT**: This one is pretty hard. First, determine how to get the "last" quantity per product. Second, coalesce null values to 0 (if you don't have null values, figure out how to rearrange your query so you do.) Third, `SET current_quantity = (...your select statement...)`, remembering that WHERE can only accommodate one column. Finally, make sure you have a WHERE statement to update the right row, you'll need to use `product_units.product_id` to refer to the correct row within the product_units table. When you have all of these components, you can run the update statement.

## MY SQL

ALTER TABLE product_units
ADD current_quantity INT;

UPDATE product_units
SET current_quantity = COALESCE((
    SELECT 
        vi.quantity 
    FROM 
        vendor_inventory vi
    WHERE 
        vi.product_id = product_units.product_id
    ORDER BY 
        vi.market_date DESC 
    LIMIT 1
),0);

SELECT *
FROM product_units
